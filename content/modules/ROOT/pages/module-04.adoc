= Lab Guide: Using Execution Environments with ansible-navigator

_A guide to configuring `ansible-navigator` to use an execution environment for running playbooks._

---

== Introduction

When sharing playbooks developed locally, communicating all the dependencies (collections, roles, Python packages, system packages, etc.) can be challenging. **Execution environments** solve this problem by bundling all necessary dependencies into container images. These images can be easily shared, ensuring that automation executes reliably everywhere.

`ansible-navigator` is designed to use these execution environments seamlessly when running your playbooks.

---

== Task 1: Enable the Execution Environment

Up to this point, `ansible-navigator` has been running using only the built-in modules without a specific execution environment. Let's configure it to use the default execution environment image.

.   **Modify `ansible-navigator.yml`.** Open the `ansible-navigator.yml` file in your home directory (`/home/rhel`). **Change** the `enabled` setting under the `execution-environment` block from `false` to `true`. The relevant part of the file should now look like this:
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
ansible-navigator:
  execution-environment:
    container-engine: podman
    image: ee-supported-rhel8:2.0.0
    enabled: true        # <-- Change this line
    pull-policy: never
  # ... rest of the file
----
+
**Save** the file.

---

== Task 2: Run a Playbook with the Execution Environment

Now, re-run your test playbook. `ansible-navigator` will detect the configuration change and use the specified execution environment.

.   **Re-run your test playbook** in the terminal:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator run ./test.yml
----
+
Notice that `ansible-navigator` recognizes it should use an execution environment. Since the image isn't present locally, it will automatically pull the `ee-supported-rhel8:2.0.0` image from a container registry. (Note: `ansible-navigator.yml` can also be configured to pull images from your organization's Private Automation Hub).

.   **Verify successful execution.** Once the image pull is complete, your `test.yml` playbook should execute successfully within the containerized environment.

---

== Task 3: Inspect the Execution Environment

You can use `ansible-navigator` itself to inspect the contents of the execution environment you just pulled.

.   **View installed collections.** While still in the `ansible-navigator` TUI from the previous step (or by running `ansible-navigator` again), issue the `:collections` subcommand by typing `:collections` and pressing Enter. This will show you all the Ansible collections included within the execution environment image.

.   **Find module author information.** While inspecting the collections list, navigate into the `ansible.utils` collection (press the corresponding number). Find the `fact_diff` module within this collection. View its details (press the corresponding number again) and locate the author information. Note the GitHub handle associated with the author. You can press `Esc` multiple times to return to the main menu or exit.
