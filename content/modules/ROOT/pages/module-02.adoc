= Lab Guide: Exploring the ansible-navigator Interface

_A guide to exploring the `ansible-navigator` Textual User Interface (TUI) and its features._

---

== Introduction

In this challenge, you will explore the link:https://github.com/ansible/ansible-navigator[`ansible-navigator`] interface and highlight some of its key features for developing and testing Ansible automation. `ansible-navigator` provides a context-aware TUI that integrates with documentation and improves the experience of navigating playbook outputs.

== Task: Navigating the TUI and Running Playbooks

Let's dive into the `ansible-navigator` TUI and try out some commands.

.   **Launch `ansible-navigator`** by running the command with no options in the integrated terminal:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator
----
+
You are now in the `ansible-navigator` TUI. By default, it shows the `:welcome` screen, providing a quick overview of available subcommands. Type `:help` and press Enter for more detailed information.

.   **View module documentation.** Try displaying the documentation for the `ping` module by typing the following subcommand and pressing Enter:
+
[source,text]
----
:doc ping
----
+
You can scroll through the documentation using the arrow keys. To exit the documentation view (and return to the previous screen), press the `Esc` key. To exit the TUI completely, type `:quit` and press Enter.

.   **Run a playbook in TUI mode.** Run your simple `test.yml` playbook again, but this time omit the `-m stdout` option to use the default TUI mode:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator run ./test.yml
----
+
NOTE: You can also run playbooks from *within* the TUI by typing `:run ./test.yml` and pressing Enter.

.   **Explore the playbook results.** The TUI displays the results of the playbook run. You navigate by using the number keys corresponding to lines on the screen and the `Esc` key to go back. **Press the number** corresponding to the play (`[this is just a test]`) to drill down into its tasks. You will see a list of tasks that ran.

.   **Inspect task details and documentation.** Now, **press the number** corresponding to the `Gathering Facts` task (usually `0`). This shows the details for that specific task. From here, you can quickly access the documentation for the module used in the task. Type the subcommand `:doc` and press Enter to view the documentation for the `setup` module (which is used by `gather_facts`). Press `Esc` twice to return to the list of tasks, and `Esc` again to return to the list of plays.

TIP: Wondering how to select a line number greater than 9? Simply prepend the number with a colon (e.g., `:15` selects line 15).

.   **Run subcommands directly from the command line.** You don't always need to enter the TUI first. You can pass subcommands directly. For example, to view the documentation for the `setup` module directly from your shell prompt, exit the TUI (`Esc` until you exit, or `:quit`) and run:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator doc setup
----

Remember, if you ever get lost within the `ansible-navigator` TUI, pressing `Esc` will always take you back to the previous screen. Pressing `Esc` on the main screen will exit the application.
